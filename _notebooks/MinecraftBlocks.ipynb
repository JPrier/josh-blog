    "To answer this question we must first collect data. To do this I created a minecraft mod that randomly teleports the player, samples a 500x50x500 (X,Y,Z) set of blocks around the player and logs those blocks into a csv. It repeats this a total of 10 times creating 10 samples of 500x50x500 blocks\n",
