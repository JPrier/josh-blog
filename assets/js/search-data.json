            "content": "Wanting to relearn the ML basics from my university degree I started going through the course Neural Networks From Scratch. . This post contains my notes and learnings from the course. . The Basics of a Layer . A layer of a neural network contains 1 or more neurons, these neurons will take a vector (or matrix with batches) as input and have a vector of weights to multiply by each of the inputs and a bias to add to the input*weights. . input = [1, 2] weights = [1,2] bias = 1 # output of a single neuron output = inputs*weights + bias . This is easily scaled up to multiple neurons with matrices . import numpy as np inputs = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.5] weights = [[0.2, 0.8, -0.5, 1], [0.5, -0.91, 0.26, -0.5], [-0.26, -0.27, 0.17, 0.87]] biases = [2.0, 3.0, 0.5] layer_outputs = np.dot(weights, inputs) + biases . Tip: numpy shape has an out to in order s.t. in shape(x,y) x is the size of the outmost dimension and y is the size of the most inner dimension . Each layer is essentially the dot product the weights and the previous layer’s output (input data for the first layer) . Batches . In the previous examples we take a vector as an input input = [1,2]. This vector is a single object in our dataset, this can be an image of a dog, the values a house sold, (x,y) values of a point, or anything else. Each value is a feature of the object, a feature describes some aspect of the object. In the case of points on a 2d graph the features for the objects would be the x and y coordinates of each point so our input in this case would be [x, y]. . We do not want to pass a single object as input for each pass of the neural network, this would be slow and would take forever for large datasets. Instead of passing single objects we can pass multiple objects at once in what is called a batch. . A batch will contain 2 or more vectors, typically we have batch sizes of 16-64 with 32 being common. Too small of a batch size will cause the neural network to underfit, this is due to the model not getting enough information in each pass causing it to make too large of a change to the parameters on each pass. Too large of a batch size will cause the neural network to overfit, this is due to it fitting to too much of the sample data at once which will cause the test accuracy to be much lower. . Activation Functions . The Basics . The activation function is a tool to adjust how and when a neuron of the network should activate. A network will typically use a different activation function between the output and hidden layers. . We use the activation function with the calculation of the weights, inputs, and bias per neuron . output = Activaiton(weights*input + bias) . Step Function . A simple activation function is the step function . x = weights*inputs + bias if x &gt; 0 y = 1 else y = 0 . The step function is a binary on or off for a neuron, 1 or 0 depending on the value of the calculation . Linear Activation Function . Sigmoid Function . ReLU .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
